        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Effective date: January 1, 2024</p>
        <p>Thank you for choosing to book with our travel agency.</p>
        
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>We understand that plans may change, and sometimes you may need to cancel your trip. Our refund policy varies depending on the type of booking and timing of cancellation.
      At our travel agency, we understand that circumstances may arise which necessitate the cancellation of travel plans. Our refund policy is designed to accommodate such situations while maintaining fairness and transparency for our customers. Depending on the type of booking and timing of cancellation, refunds may vary. For cancellations made within 24 hours of booking, a full refund is typically provided. However, after this initial period, refunds may be subject to cancellation fees or non-refundable deposits, in accordance with the terms of your booking. We aim to process refunds promptly, usually within 7-14 business days from the date of cancellation request receipt. Our customer service team is available to assist you with any questions or concerns regarding our refund policy and to facilitate the refund process efficiently. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we strive to ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience, even in the event of trip cancellations.</p>
        
        <h4>Flexible Bookings</h4>
        <p>For bookings canceled within 24 hours of making the reservation, a full refund will be provided. After this period, refunds may be subject to cancellation fees or non-refundable deposits, depending on the terms of your booking.we offer flexible booking options to accommodate the changing needs and preferences of our customers. Our flexible booking policy allows travelers to make adjustments to their reservations with ease, providing peace of mind and flexibility during uncertain times. With flexible bookings, customers can often modify their travel dates or destinations, or even cancel their reservation altogether, without incurring hefty fees or penalties. This flexibility empowers travelers to adapt their plans in response to unexpected events, ensuring a stress-free and enjoyable travel experience. Whether you need to reschedule your trip due to unforeseen circumstances or simply change your mind about your itinerary, our flexible booking policy is designed to provide you with the freedom and flexibility you need to plan your travels with confidence.</p>
        
        <h4>Non-Refundable Bookings</h4>
        <p>Some bookings, such as discounted or promotional fares, may be non-refundable. In these cases, no refund will be provided if you cancel your trip.we understand that some travelers may prefer the option of non-refundable bookings, which often come with reduced prices or special promotions. Non-refundable bookings typically offer lower rates but come with the understanding that they cannot be canceled or refunded in the event of a change in plans. While non-refundable bookings may not provide the same flexibility as flexible bookings, they offer the advantage of lower upfront costs and discounted rates. It's important for travelers considering non-refundable bookings to carefully review the terms and conditions before making a reservation. By opting for non-refundable bookings, travelers can enjoy significant savings while committing to their travel plans with confidence. However, it's essential to be mindful of the non-refundable nature of these bookings and ensure that your plans are firm before completing your reservation. As always, our team is available to provide guidance and assistance in selecting the booking option that best suits your needs and preferences.</p>
